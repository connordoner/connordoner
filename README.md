### 👋🏻 Hi, I'm Connor

I'm a self-taught developer, having began learning with HTML aged nine in the summer of 2009. I'm currently working with Ruby on Rails, which amazes me - so many shortcuts!

I'm currently working at [Gurste Collective](https://www.gurstecollective.com), a tiny start-up on a journey to bring the resilience sector into the twenty-first century.

If you want to reach me, feel free to email <me@connorgurney.me.uk> or tweet me [@connordoner](https://www.twitter.com/connordoner).
